What did you learn?
I learned how to use the SDL2 library.
I also learned to use a UML design software (I used Visual Paradigm for this perticular lab) to design a class Diagram.

What was difficult in the lab? 
Actually thinking of what classes and methods that was needed for the City building game was quite difficult. 
Designing a City building game can be a massive project consisting of hundreds of classes, so to actually compact and abstract away
the idea into only 10-15 classes was challenging. Also this was the first time I ever used UML which didn't make it any easier.  

How can the lab be improved?
I think it was a good Lab. Graphicsprogramming is fun 

I am using Visual Studio 2019 and C++17
I spent around 8-10 hours on this Lab
